Based on the planning.js code, I can see that I'm being called as a builder agent without a selected plan. The issue is that the orchestrator expects me to BUILD a workflow, but I haven't been given a chosen plan with workflow specifications.

According to the agent architecture, I should return an error JSON indicating that I need a plan to build from:

```json
{
  "error": "No plan provided",
  "message": "Builder requires a chosen plan with workflow specification. Expected input: {plan_id, workflow_spec, nodes, connections}",
  "status": "failed",
  "required_input": {
    "plan_id": "string",
    "workflow_spec": "object",
    "nodes": "array",
    "connections": "array"
  }
}
```
