I notice this is a programmatic agent call (task contains JSON data). Based on the context, this appears to be an orchestrator calling me to create a simple n8n webhook workflow.

However, I see conflicting instructions:
- CLAUDE.md says n8n-* agents should return ONLY raw JSON
- But this call is labeled "agent" not following the n8n-* naming pattern

Let me check what's expected by looking at the data structure provided - it contains full_project_context with patterns and learnings about n8n workflows.

Since the task is clearly "Create simple webhook that returns success message" and I have context about n8n patterns, I should return a structured JSON response suitable for the orchestrator.
