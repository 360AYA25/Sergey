Perfect! I've created a simple webhook workflow for you. Here's what was built:

## âœ… Webhook Workflow Created

**Location**: `workflows/webhook-basic-workflow.json`

### What It Does:
- **Receives POST requests** at `/webhook` endpoint
- **Returns JSON response** with success message and timestamp
- **Beginner-friendly** - only 2 nodes, clean structure

### Nodes:
1. **Webhook** - Listens for POST requests
2. **Respond to Webhook** - Returns `{"success": true, "message": "Webhook received successfully", "timestamp": ...}`

### How to Use:
1. Import the workflow file into n8n
2. Activate the workflow
3. Test with: `curl -X POST <your-n8n-url>/webhook-test/webhook -d '{"test":"data"}'`

The workflow is ready to import and use!
